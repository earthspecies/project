# Earth Species Project

The Earth Species Project (ESP) is an open-source collaborative and nonprofit dedicated to decoding and translating animal communication. For more information on ESP, you can visit [our website](https://earthspecies.org).

We've been doing a lot of exploratory work in our Github, much of it in tutorial form. We've been gaining intuition about how to work with animal vocalizations with the tools of deep learning, as well as think about how to make exploration as a whole faster and more efficient. An example of this is the [Acoustic Representation Toolkit](https://github.com/earthspecies/project/discussions), where we implement a toolkit that allows a wide range of acoustic representations—from spectrograms, to the [HHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93Huang_transform), to deep learned—that is well documented, tested, and integrate easily with PyTorch pipelines.

Next up, we are working on more specifically on two prongs of research:

1. [The Cocktail Party Problem](https://github.com/earthspecies/cocktail-party-problem)
1. [Extending Unsupervised Human Audio Translation](https://github.com/earthspecies/audio-embeddings)

At the same time, we are working on:

* Building the [ESP Library](https://github.com/earthspecies/library), with data sets accompanied by sets of tasks, creating MNIST-like benchmarks for the animal domain.


## Get Started

* First thing to do is to [introduce yourself](https://github.com/earthspecies/project/discussions/22).
* You can also jump into [our discussions](https://github.com/earthspecies/project/discussions). We work in the open, so if using deep learning to decode and translate animal communication interests you, hop in!
